Genre of the Song: Classical

Tempo of the Song: 60 BPM (Beats Per Minute). This would be a relatively slow tempo, allowing for contemplative, emotional expressions, similar to Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata.

Lyrics or Themes: As a classical piece inspired by the Moonlight Sonata, this song will be instrumental, without any lyrics. The primary theme of the song would be a journey of the soul, a kind of introspective voyage that evokes a sense of peace, melancholy, and hopeful resolution.

Chord Progression: An evocative chord progression would be C minor, G minor, A-flat major, E-flat major, and F minor.

Additional Instructions or Preferences: Let's use mainly piano for the composition, to maintain the characteristic style of the Moonlight Sonata. However, the addition of subtle strings (violin and cello) could add depth and enhance the emotional impact.

Length of the Song: Medium. Let's aim for a 7 to 10-minute composition, allowing for rich development of themes.

Structure: Similar to the Sonata form, the piece should be structured in three parts: Exposition (where the main themes are introduced), Development (where these themes are explored and contrasted), and Recapitulation (where the main themes return, often transformed).

Mood or Emotion: The mood should be melancholic yet hopeful, embodying a sense of solitude, reflection, and introspection.

Story: Although instrumental, the music should tell a non-literal story of an individual journeying through life's struggles, reaching a point of introspection, and finally achieving an enlightened state of acceptance and peace.

Key of the Song: C minor, to keep that mournful and expressive quality present in Moonlight Sonata.

Meter of the Song: 4/4 time, which is common and versatile, allowing for a variety of rhythmic patterns.

Default Length of a Note: The quarter note (1 beat in 4/4 time) will be the default, but the piece will utilize a wide range of note lengths for expressive purpose.

Composer of the Song: As you're the one asking for it, let's say that you're the composer!

Title of the Song: "Reflections under the Silvery Glow"
