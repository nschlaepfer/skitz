Your notation is mostly correct, but there are a few syntax issues to fix and adjust. Here are the corrections:

1. There's no need for the lowercase x before the repeat sign, |1 indicates first time bar, so instead of x1, use |1. 
2. Use [1 and :|2 for alternate endings rather than w and ww.
3. For comments within the tune, use % instead of %%.
4. Keys such as Ddor9 and Ephry11 are not standard. It's better to simplify them to Dm and Em respectively.

Here's your corrected notation:

```
X:1
T:Journey Through Sonic Landscapes
C:User
M:4/4
L:1/8
