Your ABC notation output seems to be in the correct format. All the conventions expected in ABC notation such as tune headers(X:, T:, C:, M:, L:, Q:, K:), note lengths, keys, chords are present. However there are few minor corrections to be added:

1. The grace notes need to be added inside {} brackets.

2. The sharp notes should be indicated using ^ symbol only if it's not part of key signature. If it's part of key signature, just the note letter is enough. For example, ^f in the key of G Major should be just written as f, as F# is part of the key signature.

Following these corrections, the fixed output would be:

```abc
X:1
T:Progressive Jazz Journey

M:4/4
L:1/8
Q:1/4=120
