The provided output is mostly correct with the ABC syntax. However, the "^" sign used before the notes A, G, F, and C are for indicating sharps. If these are supposed to be natural notes, you don't need to place anything before them. Here is the corrected output:

X:1
T:UK Drill Instrumental
R:UK Drill
M:4/4 
L:1/16 
K:Bmin

The notes are now in their natural form, except for the B minor key signature, which includes a C sharp and F sharp by default.
