Absolutely, let's create a detailed plan for a blues song with piano as the main instrument:

**Genre of the song:** Blues, a genre deeply rooted in African-American history, known for its emotive content and specific structural features.

**Tempo of the song:** Moderate to slow, mirroring the introspective, melancholic nature of blues music. The tempo could range from around 60-90 BPM.

**Specific lyrics or themes:** Although this is an instrumental piece, common themes in blues music revolve around hardship, love, loss, and struggle. These themes should influence the musical mood of the piece, guiding the choice of key, melody, and harmonic progression.

**Desired chord progression:** Blues music typically features a 12-bar blues progression, often represented as I-I-I-I-IV-IV-I-I-V-IV-I-I (or a variation thereof) in Roman numeral notation. In this piece, we could add complexity by using extended chords (such as 7ths, 9ths, and 13ths), chromatic passing tones, and secondary dominant chords.

**Additional instructions or preferences:** The piano part should balance rhythmic drive with melodic expressiveness. The left hand could provide a steady, walking bass line, while the right hand plays a soulful, improvised melody, using blues scales and ornamentations (like grace notes, slides, and trills).

**Desired length of the song:** A typical blues song can last anywhere from 3-5 minutes, allowing for various repetitions and variations of the 12-bar form.

**Specific structure:** A traditional blues structure involves repeating the 12-bar blues progression multiple times, with different melodic lines and solos each time. This might be represented as Intro-Verse-Solo-Verse-Solo-Outro.

**Specific mood or emotion:** Blues music is typically emotive and expressive, often conveying feelings of sadness, longing, or resilience. This can be achieved through the choice of minor keys, blues scales, lyrical melodies, and expressive dynamics and articulations.

**The story:** Even without lyrics, the piece can convey a narrative of struggle, heartache, resilience, and liberation, expressed through the evolution of melody and dynamics.

**Key of the song:** We could choose E-flat minor, a key that can help to evoke the melancholic mood of blues music.

**Meter of the song:** A meter of 4/4 would be suitable, as this is very common in blues music. However, the rhythms should be heavily syncopated, with a strong emphasis on the "off-beats."

**Default length of a note:** The length of a note will vary depending on the melodic line and rhythmic feel, but a combination of dotted rhythms, triplets, and swung eighth notes would create a characteristic blues shuffle rhythm.

**Composer of the song:** OpenAI's GPT-4

**Title of the song:** "Ebony Blues"
