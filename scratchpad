Sure, let's aim to create a piece in the style of Mozart, one of the foremost composers from the Classical period.

1. Genre of the song: Classical piano
2. Tempo of the song: Let's consider Allegro (fast and bright), a common tempo for Mozart's piano works.
3. Specific lyrics or themes: No lyrics, but in terms of themes, Mozart often used simple melodies that were then developed and varied throughout a piece. 
4. Desired chord progression: Chord progressions in classical music can be complex, often using standard progressions (like I-IV-V-I) but also incorporating secondary dominants, diminished chords, and modulations to other keys. 
5. Additional instructions or preferences: Incorporate elements of Mozart's style: clarity, balance, and transparency; an emphasis on melodic line; clever use of rhythm and harmony; and playful, inventive development of musical ideas.
6. Desired length of the song: Medium to long, to allow for the development of themes (perhaps 4-6 minutes). Mozart's piano sonatas, for example, typically last around 15-25 minutes, but since we're creating a single piece rather than a full sonata, it can be shorter.
7. Specific structure: Classical Sonata form, which consists of three main sections: Exposition (two contrasting themes), Development (elaboration and exploration of themes), and Recapitulation (return of the themes in the home key).
8. Specific mood or emotion: Energetic and joyful, yet also sophisticated and intricate. Mozart's music often conveys a sense of optimism and elegance.
9. The story: The piece doesn't need to tell a specific narrative story, but should convey a musical journey from the exposition of the main themes, through their development, to their final resolution.
10. Key of the song: Choose a major key for a joyful mood. Let's use C Major, a common key for Mozart.
11. Meter of the song: A meter of 4/4 would be suitable for a piece in the style of Mozart.
12. Default length of a note: This will vary throughout the piece depending on the specific rhythms used, but a good starting point might be eighth or sixteenth notes, reflecting the quick tempos often used by Mozart.

14. Title of the song: "A Modern Amadeus"

Again, please remember that creating music in the style of a specific composer is a complex task, and these answers only provide a broad overview of some of the considerations involved. There is much more to Mozart's style than can be encapsulated in a few brief points.
